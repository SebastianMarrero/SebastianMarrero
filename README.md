# Hi, I'm Sebastian Marrero

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a data-driven professional with experience in financial technology, SaaS, and data analysis. I use SQL, Python, Tableau, and Jupyter to turn messy data into clear insights. Whether it's through modeling credit card fraud in an expansive analysis, building dashboards for the NYC airbnb housing market, modeling SaaS customer churn, or analyzing unicorn companies, I'm always striving to build perspective through data and make the world and its infinite complexities a little easier to understand.

In addition to driving data-backed insights, I'm curious about building business strategy and how the global market interacts with each other, whether via the expansive global supply chain, in the equity markets, or the political sphere. I'm equally interested in the psychology side of business, with the idea of black swans - extremely improbable events with enormous impact and consequences proposed by former options trader author Nassim Nicholas Taleb - being the focal point of my studies as I read his book "The Black Swan" for leisure. 

I'm eager to learn anything that catches my attention and imagination, and have centered my professional ambitions around employing the knowledge and skillset I've cultivated to help businesses sharing my vision and values achieve their goals and objectives.

## Personal Writing and Interests

In addition to data and analytics, I have a strong interest in political philosophy and critical theory. During my time at Vanderbilt, I authored a research paper for my 2021 Critical Theory Philosophy course, where I explored the historical relationship between capitalism and racism through the lens of Nancy Fraser’s work:

[Read the paper: *Capitalism’s Contingent Entanglement with Racism*](https://github.com/SebastianMarrero/SebastianMarrero/blob/main/Writing%20Sample.pdf)

Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with friends, basketball, listening to music and music production, or reading about global markets and business psychology.
